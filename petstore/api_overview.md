In computer programming, an application programming interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, communication protocols, and tools for building software.
In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication among various components.
A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer.

## Libraries and frameworks
A single API can have multiple implementations (or none, being abstract) in the form of different libraries that share the same programming interface.
The separation of the API from its implementation can allow programs written in one language to use a library written in another.
For example, because Scala and Java compile to compatible bytecode, Scala developers can take advantage of any Java API.[2]
API use can vary depending on the type of programming language involved.
An API for a procedural language such as Lua could consist primarily of basic routines to execute code,
manipulate data or handle errors while an API for an object-oriented language, such as Java, would provide a specification of classes and its class methods.
Language bindings are also APIs.
Moreover, the overall program flow of control can be out of the control of the caller and in the hands of the framework by inversion of control or a similar mechanism.
